Dumb (Hard) Shuffle

I made this file to create a "hard shuffle" for a mp3 player.
This devide don't have a shuffle function and I don't want to keep listening to the same music in the same order.

To fix this issue, I made this python script to copy all music in a random order with a numered filename.

This script uses Python 3.

PS.: I did not search for others solutions. I wanted to make this by myself as a way to learn the language.
